# Storm Movement Machine Learning

Our Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model predicts a tropical cyclone's next 24 hours of movement based its last 24 hours of characteristics. The model is trained on a dataset of tropical cylones from 1851 to 2015. The dataset comprised of the features of storms at every 6 hour interval beginning with its genesis. There are a total of 2,864 storms consisting of 75,242 data points. Features used for training the model included the Longitude, Latitude, Maximum Wind, Status, and Hours since Genesis.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle under "Hurricanes and Typhoons, 1851-2014" from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
